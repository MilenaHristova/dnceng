# Jeremiah's Project

## Brief Project Summary:
The project aims to create an Azure AI-powered service that can answer questions from .NET customers. Customers can enter their questions in our prompt software service, and the service will search through our resources and documentation to provide an answer.

## Business Objective: 
Minimize the necessity of answering customer issues that can be resolved by referring to the "dotnet/arcade" GitHub repository.

## Customer Objective: 
Establish an automated and efficient way for customers to have their documentation-involved questions answered conveniently.

## How would the technology interact with the customer?
- The Azure OpenAI's prompt-driven conversation would be used in the project. The user would type and send a message to ask questions. The AI would analyze the user's question and send a response message to the user.

## From where are the resources and documents sourced?
- The resources and documents are sourced from the "Documentation" directory located in the public GitHub repository "dotnet/arcade".

## Which particular question scenarios will be tackled?
- We are addressing questions that can be found in the "Documentation" directory of the public GitHub repository "dotnet/arcade". For instance, the question, What are SDL Scripts",  can be accessed directly in the "HowToAddSDLRunToPipeline.md" file.
